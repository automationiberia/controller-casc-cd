Now, we are going to create a few objects for the new organization with a GitOps approach.

There is already a repository deployed with a some example playbooks: #ToDo: URL al repo#. A project pointing to this repository will be created.

The following steps will populate and deploy different obects in the controller: a project, a job_template, an inventory and a credential.
Once these new objects were deployed, an intentionally wrong change will be made to, afterwards, test a rollback.

== Clone the repository and create a new branch

====
[.console-input]
[source,console]
git clone git@gitlab.com:%GITLABGROUP%/%ORGNAME%.git
cd %ORGNAME%/
git checkout -b creation_new_objects
