= Day-0: Deploy the SUPERADMIN organization

Once all the objects are already configured at the GitLab repository, they can be deployed for the first time into the target Automation Controller.

== Create the objects in the Controller

[IMPORTANT]
====
In order to be able to run the playbooks from the command line using `ansible-navigator`, the files `.vault_password*` are needed and must contain the different vault passwords to decrypt the vaulted files:

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
read -e -s -p "Enter Vault password for DEV environment: " VAULT_PASSWORD_DEV
echo "${VAULT_PASSWORD_DEV}" > .vault_password_dev
----

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
read -e -s -p "Enter Vault password for PRO environment: " VAULT_PASSWORD_PRO
echo "${VAULT_PASSWORD_PRO}" > .vault_password_pro
----

That file may already be ignored in the contents of the `.gitignore`, so it can't be uploaded to the GitLab repository. See the xref:021-initial-dir-and-files.adoc#_housekeeping_optional_steps[Housekeeping Optional Steps]
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Another important thing to remember is to add the public key part of
the private key configured at
`orgs_vars/$\{SUPERADMIN_ORG\}/env/dev/controller_credentials.d/controller_credentials_scm.yml`
to the GitLab repositories used by the configured projects. See the xref:021-initial-dir-and-files.adoc#_dev_source_control_manager_and_gitlab_api_token_credentials_will_let_the_job_templates_to_connect_to_the_gitlab_repositorygroup[(dev) Source Control Manager and GitLab API Token Credentials will let the Job Templates to connect to the GitLab repository/group]
====

Run the configuration playbook to create the defined objects in the target AAP Controllers, for both DEV and PRO environments, running the following commands:

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
ansible-navigator run casc_ctrl_config.yml -i inventory -l dev -e "{orgs: ${SUPERADMIN_ORG}, dir_orgs_vars: orgs_vars, env: dev}" -m stdout --eei quay.io/automationiberia/aap/ee-casc:latest --vault-id dev@.vault_password_dev --vault-id pro@.vault_password_pro --pull-arguments=--tls-verify=false
----

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
ansible-navigator run casc_ctrl_config.yml -i inventory -l pro -e "{orgs: ${SUPERADMIN_ORG}, dir_orgs_vars: orgs_vars, env: pro}" -m stdout --eei quay.io/automationiberia/aap/ee-casc:latest --vault-id dev@.vault_password_dev --vault-id pro@.vault_password_pro --pull-arguments=--tls-verify=false
----

[TIP]
====
The following requirements must be taken in consideration:

* `ansible-navigator` command must be available to run the playbook
* An Execution Environment with all the required collections must exist and be available to be pulled and used:
+
.See the `requirements.yaml` contents
[%collapsible]
=====
[source,yaml]
----
include::../examples/collections/requirements.yaml[]
----
=====

* The target AAP Controller must be available when running the previous command
====

[TIP]
====
The files `.vault_password*` used in the previous command, must exist and contain the different vault passwords needed to access the vaulted variables
====

[TIP]
====
The file `inventory` must be filled accordingly to the corresponding `group_vars` configuration file to reach the correct Automation Controller instance
====

== Configure the GitLab Webhooks

Once the objects has been created at the Ansible Automation Controller, there are two options to configure the GitLab Webhook to run the Continuous Integration for the CasC:

=== Dev environment

[tabs]
=====
Automatically::
+
A Job Template and a Project have been created to automatically configure the GitLab Webhook making use of the `GitLab API Token` credential defined and vaulted in the configuration files (take a look at [`orgs_vars/$\{SUPERADMIN_ORG\}/env/dev/controller_credentials.d/controller_credentials_gitlab_api_token.yml`](orgs_vars/superadmin/env/dev/controller_credentials.d/controller_credentials_gitlab_api_token.yml)):
+
Launch the Job Template called `{{ orgs }} dev Gitlab Webhook Creation`:
+
.Configure Webhook Launch
image::configure_webhook_launch_dev.png[]
+
Configure the following webhook trigger parameters for the `dev` environment:
+
.Configure Webhook Trigger Parameters
+
image::configure_webhook_launch_params_dev.1.png[]
+
.Configure Webhook Params
image::configure_webhook_launch_params_dev.2.png[]
+
After running the Job, the webhook will already be configured at the git repository for the specified organization, which will point to the selected Job Template in the selected Automation Controller.
+
.Configure Webhook Result
image::configure_webhook_result_dev.png[]

Manually::
+
Following steps must be performed to configure the GitLab Webhook to run the Continuous Integration for the CasC in the specified organization:
+
1. Get the `id` number of the Job Template which will receive the webhook calls:
+
.Configure Webhook Get Config
image::configure_webhook_get_config_dev.png[]
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The Url displayed in the (Workflow) Job Template configuration is using the ID to identify the (Workflow) Job Template, but it's not recommended to use this identifier, as it can change if the configuration is applied to different AAP instances. Instead, the `named_url` from the API may be used.

.Configure Webhook Named URL
image::configure_webhook_named_url_dev.png[]
====

2. Set the webhook information at the GitLab repository:
+
.Configure webhook Set Info
image::configure_webhook_set_info_dev.png[]

=== Pro environment

[tabs]
=====
Automatically::
+
A Job Template and a Project have been created to automatically configure the GitLab Webhook making use of the `GitLab API Token` credential defined and vaulted in the configuration files (take a look at [`orgs_vars/$\{SUPERADMIN_ORG\}/env/pro/controller_credentials.d/controller_credentials_gitlab_api_token.yml`](orgs_vars/superadmin/env/pro/controller_credentials.d/controller_credentials_gitlab_api_token.yml)):
+
Launch the Job Template called `{{ orgs }} pro Gitlab Webhook Creation`:
+
.Configure Webhook Launch
image::configure_webhook_launch_pro.png[]

Configure the following webhook trigger parameters for the `dev` environment:

== All done

Now, all the initial configuration is done and from that moment, only pushing new commits to the `dev` branch will create or update all the objects at the Automation Controller.

Follow with the xref:023-superadmin-create-new-organization.adoc[Day-2: Create a new Organization] steps to create normal organizations.
